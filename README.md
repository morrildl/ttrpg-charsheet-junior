A US Half-Letter (5.5" x 8.5") D&D 5e character sheet, suitable for use in a disc-bound notebook.

You should not use this. You should buy something like [Cantrips Media character
sheets](https://cantripsmedia.com/products/character-sheets-for-d-d-5e-player-size-notebooks?variant=44951519854819)
which inspired this project. I did my version because I pedantically wanted a double-sided character
sheet, where Cantrips' are laid out side-by-side. Also, I kinda did it just to see if I could.

The layout in [charsheet.html](charsheet.html) is for a single US Letter (8.5" x 11") sheet. Once
printed, it yields two copies of the character sheet after the US Letter "parent" page is cut in
half into two US Half-Letter (5.5" x 8.5") sheets.

The layout contains margins sufficient to allow holes to be punched in the half-Letter "child"
sheets for use a disc-bound notebook system.

This document could be adjusted to A5 with minor edits to the CSS, updating the dimensions.

## Usage

To use:

1. `git clone` the repo, or even just download `charsheet.html` and the `assets/` directory
2. Open the file in a browser, via a `file:///` URL
3. Print the HTML page (ctrl-P)

Alternatively, if you don't want to make any tweaks, just download and print
[charsheet.pdf](charsheet.pdf).


## 3D Models for Plates

I also made a few 3D models for disc-bound notebooks.

[This 2mm-thick back
plate](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5505ea7329ec1e8cba2426c4/w/84436b9c585ca8cf7dc2e4ac/e/3d3145a5980725337754c8cd)
prints up as a very solid writing surface, comparable to using a clipboard. It will fight you a
little bit when you try to add the discs, but once they're in it grips them "just right" so that
they don't flop around much, while still allowing pages to turn easily.

[This 0.75mm-thick
cover](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/f8f661f421c548fc65ea0b26/w/8aaffb41f5c480bc764f2828/e/06d77aec9bf6c64a84fcb9c2)
is a version of the back plate above, but at 0.75mm thick. When printed, this will be stiff but
flexible, making for a decent protective cover.

[This horizontal
bookmark](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/17570db548acda438b8d99d4/w/8ee36746cc3cfb89cfcfb844/e/2e9c309bc402fce69fa6f012)
sits on two adjacent discs and extends out ~5mm past the page edge. This is essentially like a
tabbed divider page, but in a bookmark-style form factor.
