This project contains US Half-Letter (aka Junior) sized character sheets for a couple TTRPGs.

## What Is

"Half-Letter" is, predictably, half of a US Letter page -- 5.5" x 8.5". It is the counterpart of A5,
just as US Letter is the counterpart of A4. Apparently this format is properly called
[Invoice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size#Variant_American_loose_sizes), but as far as I
can tell paper sellers seem to call it Half-Letter or Junior.

Note that technically Half-Letter *is not* the same as Junior, though the two are close;
Junior is the equivalent small-size format for US-Legal. Junior is 5" x 8"; Half-Letter is 5.5" x
8.5". Unfortunately a lot of paper sellers and discbound players use "Junior" to refer to
Half-Letter, so the waters are quite muddy; as far as I can tell anything I've ever seen
that was called "Junior" was actually Half-Letter.

**All that said, to be very clear, this project is Half-Letter, 5.5" x 8.5".**

## But Why

There are many alternative TTRPG character sheets out there, but nearly all are for full-size
US-Letter pages. However, I wanted a Half-Letter version.


### y tho

So that I can keep my character sheet in the same [disc-bound
notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc-binding) I use for taking notes while playing a TTRPG. And because I wanted to see if I could.
